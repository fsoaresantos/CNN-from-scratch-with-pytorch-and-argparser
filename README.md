# CNN-from-scratch-with-pytorch-and-argparser

**Personal Note** about the creation of **python script** with `%%writefile` command and the use of **argparser module** to define command-line arguments.
It illustrate the creation and trainning of an image classification model based on a CNN and the CIFAR10 dataset.

Keywords: pytorch, torch.nn.Module, convolutional layer, convolutional neural network, image classification, pooling layer, fully connected layer, ReLU function, argparser, python script
